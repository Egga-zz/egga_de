Often times there is a connection drawn between programming and maths. I think that's not right at all.

Programming is about language. Speaking to and understanding humans. It's a communication task.

We work in teams, relying on other teams. Agile is about humans and communication.

We draw to explain to others. Or to understand.

All the clean code practices are about communication. Except those that are about changing code. Which is because of humans, not machines.
